This is a hologram pyramid model.
Print the STL file with a 3D printer, but pay careful attention to the dimensions when you do so.
The pyramid is already in the correct proportions, all you need to do is scale the model to meet the following dimensions:
height: 2.45cm
base1: 1cm
base2: 6cm

Make a high quality print of the model and then sand it. 
I started with a 60 grit piece of sandpaper to grind down the ridges, then I used something less rough, like 180 to refine the surface.
Finally, I used 2 small sheets of 800 grit sandpaper to give the surface a smooth finish.

Once you are done sanding the model, use a vacuum former with clear, PETG 0.020 <unknown unit> (inches are assumed) thick plastic to make the desired pyramid.

You will need some double-sided clear mounting tape.
Attach the tape to the small 1x1cm base of the pyramid, remove the adhesive backing from the other side of the tape and attach it to the center of your device's screen.

Lastly,
Find or make a hologram video and play it on your device.
NOTE: to properly view the hologram, view it perpendicularly to your screen.

For more information, please view the images included in the documentation folder of this project.
Each image name corresponds to the order of each step in the process of making the pyramid.
