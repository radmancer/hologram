This is a hologram pyramid model.
Print the STL file with a 3D printer, but pay careful attention to the dimensions when you do so.
The pyramid is already in the correct proportions, all you need to do is scale the model to meet the following dimensions:
height: 3.5cm
base1: 1cm
base2: 6cm

I recommend a dense, high quality print to minimize the ridged appearance that 3D prints usually have. I also recommend sanding the pyramid to further smooth out those annoying ridges.

Once you are done sanding the model, use a vacuum former with clear plastic to make the desired pyramid. Cut the small 1 cm base out of the pyramid and place it on your phone, tablet, or any device capable of playing video.
NOTE: make sure the larger base of the pyramid is on top!

-or-

If you wish, you can just print the model and use it as a drawing template.  You can place the pyramid on a sheet of clear plastic and trace around each face of the pyramid. After that, go ahead and cut out each face and tape them together with clear tape.

Lastly,
Find or make a hologram video and play it on your device.
NOTE: to properly view the hologram, view it perpendicularly to your screen.
